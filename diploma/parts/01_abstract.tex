\section*{Abstract}

In this work I present a rule-based morphological analysis tool based on Helsinki Finite-State Technology (HFST) for the Shughni language (ISO: sgh; glottocode: shug1248), a language of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family, a member of Pamiri areal language group. This work proposes the first HFST-based morphological parser implementation for Shughni, offering the advantages of this well-established framework for morphological analysis. The parser is presented in two variations: a morphological parser that breaks each word-form into stem and morphemes and assigns morphological tags to each one of them; and a morphological generator that outputs word-forms taking a stem and morphological tags as an input. This is a continuation of my previous work, where nouns, pronouns, prepositions and numerals were implemented \parencite{osorgin_2024_twol}. Despite the title, the current work fills the gap by covering all known Part of speech tags for Shughni. The resulting morphological parser covers $87.8\%$ of native corpus' tokens, returning at least one correct glossing variant for $72.6\%$ of covered tokens, with $51.0\%$ of all parser's glossing variants being correct.
