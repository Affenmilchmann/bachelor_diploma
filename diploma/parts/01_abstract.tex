\section*{Abstract}

In this work I present a rule-based morphological analysis tool based on Helsinki Finite-State Technology (HFST) for the Shughni language (ISO: sgh; glottocode: shug1248), a language of the Iranian branch of the Indo-European family, a member of `Pamiri' areal language group. While one existing rule-based parser exists for Shughni \parencite{melchenko_2021_parser}, it does not utilize finite-state transducer technology. This work proposes the first HFST-based morphological parser implementation for Shughni, offering the advantages of this well-established framework for morphological analysis. The parser is presented in two variations: a morphological parser that breaks each word-form into stem and morphemes and assigns morphological tags to each one of them; a morphological generator that outputs word-forms taking a stem and morphological tags as an input. \todo{prev sentence is questionable} This is a continuation my previous work, where nouns, pronouns, prepositions and numerals were implemented \parencite{osorgin_2024_twol}.
