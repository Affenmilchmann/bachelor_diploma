\section{Conclusion}

\par In this work I will continue the development of HFST-based morphological parser for Shughni started in my prevoius work \parencite{osorgin_2024_twol}. In the first version of the parser only nouns, numerals, pronouns and prepositions were implemented. In this work I aim to fill the crucial gaps: verbs and adjectives. The addition of such important parts of speech will make the parser much more complete.
\par The hope is to introduce an alternative to the existing solution and advance the development of natural language processing tools for the Shughni language. Morphological parser can later be utilized by other NLP tools such as spell-checkers, POS-taggers, syntactic parsers, lemmatizers and more.
