\section{Abstract}

Automatic morphological analysis is one of the core tasks of computational linguistics. Shughni language, being a minority language, is one of the languages that doesn't have such essential tools. In this paper I propose a rule-based morphological analysis tool for Shughni language based on Helsinki Finite-State Technology (HFST). The tool set is planned to contain two types of tools: a morphological parser, that breaks word-forms into stems and morphemes and assigns morphological tags to each one of them, and a morphological generator, that outputs word-forms taking stems and morphological tags as an input. This project aims to cover at least three main parts of speech: nouns, verbs and adjectives. \todo{Extend the abstract and review it later}
