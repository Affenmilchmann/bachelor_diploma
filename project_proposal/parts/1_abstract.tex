\section*{Abstract}

Automatic morphological analysis is a crucial task of computational linguistics. In this work I propose a rule-based morphological analysis tool for Shughni language (ISO: sgh; glottolog: shug1248) based on Helsinki Finite-State Technology (HFST). The tool set is planned to contain two types of tools: a morphological parser that breaks word-forms into stems and morphemes and assigns morphological tags to each one of them; a morphological generator that outputs word-forms taking stems and morphological tags as an input. This project aims to cover at least three main parts of speech: nouns, verbs and adjectives. \todo{Extend the abstract and review it later}
